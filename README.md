## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Media Queries

### What I learned

I have used three media queries for three different screen sizes and
I have plans to add a new media query regarding mobile landscape viewport

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
img {
  width: 100%;
}
```

The above css property will make sure that the image always fits in
the container in which it is placed

### Continued development

I want to learn some other ways to center the main content and
apply other styles accordingly
